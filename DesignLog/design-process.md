# Design Process for the LibreCAD website

## Steps taken:
1. [Listing out given-requirements/initial ideas/self-requirements](#step1)
2. [Scouting other websites and taking notes](#step2)
3. [Sketching out a draft](#step3)
4. [Creating the actual website](#step4)
5. [Tweaking, Refining, Fine-Tuning](#step5)

### Step 1: Listing out given-requirements/initial ideas/self-requirements <a name="step1"></a>
I used my trusty notebook to write down the given requirements. Mainly, the five links, responsiveness, and no proprietary stuff. My requirements came next. Since the software and the website had an old website (but a good color scheme), it needed a complete refresh. Therefore, only links and some text will be taken and the layout will be re-written from scratch. The new keywords are plain, modern and fresh. The chosen font was "Open Sans", different from the original "Lato" or Florencesans (did not show well on display) because Open Sans had a wider font kerning - more suitable for the "open" idea of the website. Also, the new site must be highly suitable for mobiles and search engines. Therefore, SEO optimization and mobile-first design will take priority.

### Step 2: Scouting other websites amd taking notes <a name="step2"></a>
I looked at many websites to take inspiration from, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/), and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to name a few. Most websites had a navbar at the top with the logo in the top left corner, links to the right, a catchphrase in the center of screen, screenshot below it and list of features under the screenshot. Buttons were given bright colors, rounded borders, and shadows. This was quite effective and thus I used these general rules.

### Step 3: Sketching out a draft <a name="step3"></a>
Although this was not required, spending time planning will make development much faster. I opted for the above-mentioned layout and the inclusion of a call to developers on Github, a twitter feed, and sponsored and friends links (primarily because they were included on the main site). The footer was going to use js to get the titles of blog posts to have a "recently posted" list. The color pallet was 3 shades of green and 2 shades of grey. The single font was Open Sans and the unit of measure would be "em" to make the site scalable across diverse devices.

### Step 4: Creating the actual website <a name="step4"></a>
Sometimes what looks good on paper is not the same on screen, and somethings might be impractical. Therefore, the twitter feed was taken out (unable to restyle it) and the "recent posts" was removed due to security problems with accessing another site's content with js. As a result, the footer was rearranged. The download buttons under the catchphrase display according to the OS and the navbar collapses into a 3-bar button for nav menu. The main screenshot was taken from the features page.

### Step 5: Tweaking, Refining, Fine-Tuning <a name="step5"></a>
This is where the site took it's final form. SEO-friendly meta tags were added, html validation was tested, the colors were shifted around, and nuanced font-styles were put in. Button styles were redone. The nav-bar's menu button on mobiles turned into an X on clicking and back to 3-bars when pressed again. The links were given transitions and spacing was readjusted. Redundancy was removed and CSS code was optimized. Every single detail was thoroughly scrutinized. In the end, the site came out looking polished and nice.

## Summary - Major features
- Automatic download buttons based on OS.
- Super responsive for mobiles, tables, laptops, and desktops.
- Highly SEO friendly.
- Very clean and modern design.
- Visuals used well through lots of flat icons.
- Lack of frameworks and optimized css makes page load very fast.  
- *Hint* Try highlighting text
